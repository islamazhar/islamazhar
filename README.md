<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mazharul Islam</h1>
<h3 align="center">Security Privacy Researcher/Engineer</h3>

I am a Ph.D. candidate (dissertator) in computer science at the University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison, and a security privacy engineer and researcher. 
I am advised by [Prof. Rahul Chatterjee](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~chatterjee/), and I frequently collaborate with [Prof. Thomas Ristenpart](https://rist.tech.cornell.edu/) (from Cornell Tech) and [Visa Research](https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visa-research.html) where I spent the last three summers as a staff research scientist intern.

Earlier I completed my M.Sc. in computer science also from University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison in 2022, and before that completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017. 

I code in python for the ease of quick prototyping, but prefer  GO when performance and type-safety is a priority.

# ðŸ‘€ My Interest
I develop privacy preserving secure systems by designing novel **privacy enhancing technologies (PETs)**, **machine learning (ML)**  techniques, and analyzing complex attacks on large-scale datasets. My PhD thesis is in particular focuses on solving security and privacy problems of online user authentication (passwords, passkeys, and face-based). I have also been working solving data privacy issues of machine learning models using PETs.
