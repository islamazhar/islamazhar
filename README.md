<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Mazharul Islam</h1>
<h3 align="center">Security Privacy Researcher/Engineer</h3>

I am a Ph.D. candidate (dissertator) in computer science at the University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison, and a security privacy engineer and researcher. 
Earlier I completed my M.Sc. in computer science also from University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison in 2022, and before that completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017. 

I code in <code>python</code> for the ease of quick prototyping, but prefer  <code>GO</code> when performance and type-safety is a priority. I am also familer with frontend and backend software development. 

## ðŸ‘€ My Interest
Broadly my research aims to safeguard systems against emerging threats and privacy attacks.

My PhD thesis in particular looks at developing detection and prevention techniques to protect passwords, passkey based user authentication from attacks. 
My works are at the intersection of deep learning, privacy enhancing technologies, and web security.
