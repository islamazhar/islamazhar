<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Mazharul Islam</h1>
<h3 align="center">Security Privacy Researcher/Engineer</h3>

I am a Ph.D. candidate (dissertator) in computer science at the University of Wisconsin——Madison, and a security privacy engineer and researcher. 


Earlier I completed my M.Sc. in computer science also from University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2022, and before that completed my B.Sc. in computer science and engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2017. 
My PhD thesis is in particular focuses on solving security and privacy problems of online user authentication (passwords, passkeys, and face-based). I code in python (for quick prototyping), and in GO (when performance is a priority)

# 👀 My Interest
In particular I develop privacy preserving secure systems by designing novel **privacy enhancing**, **machine learning**  techniques, and analyzing complex attacks on large-scale datasets. I am advised by Prof. Rahul Chatterjee, and I frequently collaborate with Prof. Thomas Ristenpart (from Cornell Tech) and Visa Research where I spent the last three summers as a staff research scientist intern.
